== February 27, 2008 ==
This is our first release, so...everything's new! We can offer some useful starting points, though.

=== For Readers ===
  * The 'h' key reveals a keyboard help reminder. The rest of the shortcut keys are described there.
  * You can bookmark a topic at any time using your browser's normal "bookmark" command.
  * External links are designed with a small arrow. Following such links will navigate you away from the documentation view, but you can return easily by simply using normal browser navigation (back button, history, etc.).
  * You can view multiple set of documentation together in a single view by including multiple projects in a [UrlFormat custom URL].

=== For Authors ===
  * To make your project viewable with the documentation viewer, simply add a wiki page named `TableOfContents`. To add index terms, add a wiki page named `Index`. 
  * If you are signed into a project whose doc you are viewing, topics will have an "Edit" link, making it easy to edit the wiki page underlying each topic.
