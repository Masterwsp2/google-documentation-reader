Well, this is our first release.  Everything's new.

For those who may have followed earlier releases, though: 
  # we get better information for search results, 
  # we spent a lot of time on cross-browser look-and-feel considerations, including
  # The URL syntax was re-done, to be parenthetical (i.e. "_p(google-docreader)_") instead 
of key=values (the old "_p=google-docreader_") because GWT and browser both insisted on
escaping characters like equals, comma, and apersand.
