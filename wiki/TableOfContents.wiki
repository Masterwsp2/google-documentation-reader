#summary TOC for documentation about DocReader

Google's documentation reader provides an easy way to organize technical reference documentation.  It works by allowing the members of projects on code.google.com to organize their documentation as wiki pages, and then allowing users to collect documentation from the set of projects they care about into one, custom "reference library."
