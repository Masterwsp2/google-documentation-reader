#summary How documentation reader URLs are formatted

= URL Format =

All URLs for documentation reader pages begin with 
"http://code.google.com/docreader/", and usually then have a "#" character 
followed by a bunch of stuff to specify what you want to view.  This
section explains what it all means, and how you can construct URLs to specify
what you want to see.  We expect this process to get easier in future 
releases, but it's still helpful to understand what's "really" going on.

= The Encoding Schema =

Our properties take the form {{{param(value)}}}, and are additive.
So if you have {{{p(google-web-toolkit)p(google-web-toolkit-incubator)}}}, that
means that the parameter {{{p}}} (which happens to be the projects to display)
is a list of two values, google-web-toolkit and google-web-toolkit-incubator.

Experienced web gurus may notice that the text does not follow the usual 
HTTP scheme of {{{param1=value1&param2=value2}}}.  That is the encoding for the
query parameters (after ?), but some browsers "escape" the punctuation, resulting in a very unreadable mash.  So we wanted to come up with something more readable, using only the very few characters that aren't escaped after a "#" character.

With that as background, we're ready to discuss the set of properties the
documentation reader uses.

= Properties =

The following table outlines the properties you may have in a documentation 
reader URL:

|| *Property* || *Value*                || *Required?*        || *Multiple?* ||
||    p       || "project" name         || no (default to google-documentation-reader) || yes ||
||    s       || "selected" project     || yes if multiple projects    || no ||
||    t       || "topic" wikiword or header string || at most one of i, q, or t || no ||
||    i       || "index" query term     || at most one of i, q, or t   || no ||
||    q       || "query" term           || at most one of i, q, or t   || no ||
||  locale    || locale string          || no (and currently unused)   || no ||
= Examples =

  * Minimally, it is valid to just use http://code.google.com/docreader/, with no #-part.  The default project ({{{p}}}) is "google-documentation-reader," with only one project there is no need for a selected project ({{{s}}}), as it must also be google-documentation-reader, and the default topic ({{{t}}}) is the selected project's name.
    * Equivalently, we could fully specify all of that: http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-documentation-reader)s(google-documentation-reader)t(google-documentation-reader)
  * If you want to look at all of the Google Web Toolkit documentation, you would use multiple {{{p}}} terms: http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-web-toolkit)p(google-web-toolkit-incubator)p(gwt-google-apis).  
    * That URL didn't specify {{{s}}} or {{{t}}}, so it will default to the first project name, like: http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-web-toolkit)p(google-web-toolkit-incubator)p(gwt-google-apis)s(google-web-toolkit)t(google-web-toolkit)
  * If you want to pick a more specific (and perhaps directly useful!) topic and get the URL for that, perhaps to post or e-mail for others, change the {{{t}}}  property: http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-web-toolkit-incubator)t(GlassPanel)
  * If you want, instead, to bookmark a query, use {{{q}}} instead of {{{t}}}: http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-web-toolkit)p(google-web-toolkit-incubator)s(google-web-toolkit)q(Panel)
