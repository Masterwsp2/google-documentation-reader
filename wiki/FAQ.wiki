#summary Frequently asked questions about the documentation reader
=Frequently Asked Questions=

=== Search results aren't including some of my recent content.  Why? ===
The documentation reader uses Google search, and it may take some time before new pages are fully incorporated into search results.

=== Can I mix documents from other places on the web, not only projects hosted on Google Code, into my documentation? ===
No, all the topic content must come from the project's wiki. You can, of course, have outgoing links from any wiki page to external pages.
