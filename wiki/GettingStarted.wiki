#summary Quick tour of the DocReader interface and how to navigate in it.
= Introduction =
Google !DocReader is inteneded to provide a great interface for technical users browsing technical documentation.  In addition to the free search navigation you would expect from Google, it offers traditional table-of-contents and index keyword navigation.  Moreover, it is convenient:
  * [TipsForAuthors for project owners], it is easy to set projects up for use in !DocReader,
  * [TipsForAuthors for authors], it is easy to write, edit, and organize documentation pages, and most of all
  * [TipsForReaders for readers], it is easy not only to navigate the documentation of a given project, but also to collect documentation on a set of projects, to build a customize "reference library" of exactly the materials you actually use.  Searches are confined to this set of documentation, neither showing non-documentation results nor results from irrelevant projects.

  
= The screen =

The screen is divided into three basic areas: the upper header bar, the left-side navigation bar with tabs for "Contents" and "Index," and the main viewing area.  Let's take a look at each in turn.

First of all, in the header area, the "Help" link shows a pop-up of the various keyboard shortcuts.  It is possible use keystrokes to do anything !DocReader can do... a small point, perhaps, but one that can make an experienced user far faster and more productive.  (To say nothing of the assistance to disabled users!)
