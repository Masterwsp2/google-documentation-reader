#summary Quick tour of the documentation reader interface and how to navigate in it.
= Introduction =
The documentation reader is intended to provide a great interface for technical users
browsing wiki documentation in Google Code project hosting.  In addition to the free search navigation
you would expect from Google, it offers traditional table-of-contents and index
keyword navigation.  Moreover, it is convenient:
  * [TipsForAuthors for project owners], it is easy to set projects up for use in !DocReader,
  * [TipsForAuthors for authors], it is easy to write, edit, and organize documentation pages, and most of all
  * [TipsForReaders for readers], it is easy not only to navigate the documentation of a given project, but also to collect documentation on a set of projects, to build a customize "reference library" of exactly the materials you actually use.  Searches are confined to this set of documentation, neither showing non-documentation results nor results from irrelevant projects.

  
= The screen =

The screen is divided into three basic areas: the upper header bar, the 
left-side navigation bar with tabs for "Contents" and "Index," and the main 
viewing area.  Let's take a look at each in turn.

First of all, in the header area, the "Help" link shows a pop-up of the various
keyboard shortcuts.  It is possible use keystrokes to do anything !DocReader 
can do... a small point, perhaps, but one that can make an experienced user far
faster and more productive.  (To say nothing of the assistance to disabled 
users!)

Next, on the left hand side, is a navigation area.  The image shows that with
the "Contents" tab selected; we'll show the "Index" tab a bit later.  The
Contents view shows a tree representation of the tables of contents for each 
project (here, we have two visible).  Again, keyboard navigation should work 
properly, and you can easily move between looking at one project and then at 
another.  Click any of the links, and the display area will update to show the
page you asked for.  Click on the small "+" and "-" buttons to expand or 
collapse the tree.  With the keyboard, up/down navigate, enter selects, and 
left/right arrows collapse and expand.

If you find the navigation area takes up too much screen space, you can 
collapse it by clicking anywhere in the vertical bar containing the 
"[http://google-documentation-reader.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/collapse.png]" icon.

Finally, in the viewing area, we have the documentation currently being 
displayed.  In the top right corner, the "Print" link is always available; the
"Edit" link is available only to members of the project, and provides a fast
route to edit the wiki page (for example, to immediately correct the typo an 
editor just noticed on the page).  Under the blue separator line, a 
"breadcrumbs" row identifies where in the table of contents this page is 
organized, making it easy to go up to a parent node and then down to siblings 
even if the navigation area is collapsed.

And, of course, the main documentation itself will usually contain links.  Most
links will go to other documentation sections, and will also cause the 
selection in the Contents tab to be updated.  A few links may be external, and 
marked with a 
"[http://google-documentation-reader.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/extlink.png]"
icon.  These will leave the documentation for some other site.  In the case 
here, it takes you to another site showing running example code.

= Searches =
Results of a "Search Contents" search are automatically restricted only to 
documentation results.  Because the documentation reader has additional 
information from the table of contents, we can also provide more information
in the search results, compared to what an ordinary web search can display: we
give the actual title of the page rather than the wiki word of its entry, and
the breadcrumbs to the page provide a link not only to the result page with
your search term, but to other containing sections as well.

= Using the Index =

In many respects, the index is just a collection of what the authors of the
various projects' documentation thought might be useful search terms.  When 
you select the Index tab in the navigation area, you see a list of index links,
and clicking one of those will run a search for that term exactly as though you
had typed it into the search box in the header area.

Given this equivalence, the primary value of the index is precisely that it
can _suggest_ search terms.  If you are looking for a concept, but really just
don't know what it is called, try looking in the index.  At the very least,
you may find something interesting or something that you're not sure what is, 
even if you _do_ have some ideas of search terms for a free-text search!

The box labelled "Filter" above the keywords is useful when you have a very
large index, especially one from multiple projects merged together.  If you
type something in the filter box, the index list will adjust to show only 
those index terms containing the string you have typed, as shown below.  To get
back to the entire list, just delete the filter string.
