#summary Notes on which browser configurations are supported, and any browser-specific caveats
=Supported Browsers=
We expect the documentation reader to work with any modern browser.  We specifically test with:
  * Internet Explorer 6 and 7 (Windows)
  * Firefox 2 and 3 (Linux, Mac, and Windows)
  * Safari 3 (Mac)
  * Opera 9.5 (Mac and Windows)

If you have any problems, though -- [http://code.google.com/p/google-documentation-reader/issues/list put in a bug report].
